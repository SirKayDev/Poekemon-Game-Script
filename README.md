# Pokémon-Game-Script
This repository contains all the C# scripts I developed for my Pokémon Game Project in Unity. It includes core gameplay systems such as player movement, battle mechanics, UI handling, game state management, and more. The codebase reflects over 3,000 lines of custom logic built to replicate classic Pokémon gameplay within the Unity engine.
